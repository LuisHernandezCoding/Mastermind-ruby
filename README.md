# Mastermind-ruby
In this project, i made a Mastermind game that can be executed and played from console, its for 1 player vs the computer

The main goal is to put into practice main concepts from Object Oriented Programming (OOT) but mostly classes and their attributes.

###### Definition

> Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game for two players. It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back a century.

###### Behavior

- The first player, the code maker (in this case the computer), chooses a pattern of code pegs. 
- Duplicates and blanks are allowed depending on the game mode. 
- The second player, the codebreaker (the real player), tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color. 
- There is a difficulty parameter so it can change the code size from 4 at beginner up to 8
- Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board. 
- Once placed, the code maker provides feedback by answering how much guess are exact correct, and how much are color correct
